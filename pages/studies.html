Recommendation no. 1 - when reading through a course material or syllabus - especially in an applied course - make sure to check the recommended papers/readings, and MOST importantly projects and assignments -try doing them.

Recommendation no. 2 - this one might be unconventional but I love textbooks, they're perfect for deep work! Pick one with good reviews and give it a try. ðŸ¤“ -->
