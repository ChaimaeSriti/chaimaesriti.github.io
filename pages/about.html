        <h2>motto</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "To this day, i remain convinced of this basic philosophy: no matter what quandaries we face [...] there is an idea that can enable us to prevail. Furthermore, we can find that idea. And when we find it, we need to implement it. My life has been shaped by this imperative. The power of an idea - this is itself an idea." - Ray Kurzweil.

        <h1>about</h1>
        <p>hi, fellow human ðŸ”† - i am chaÃ¯mae "shai-muh". i identify as a strong generalist and would never (or not) subject myself to the pain 
            of specialization. 
            currently, i am focused on studying data, people, and intelligence.</p>
        <p>when i am not building models or optimizing data pipelines, i am either working on personal 
            research projects involving AI, neuroscience, and psychology OR reading a philosophy book. i must say, 
            it has been a delightful journey - it keeps boredom away.</p>
        <p>i also have two sacred rituals: 1. practicing piano, and 2. going on a daily get-as-much-sun-as-you-can 
            forty minutes walk. i happily live in montreal.</p>
