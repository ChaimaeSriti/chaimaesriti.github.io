    <section class="about">
        <p>I identify as a strong generalist and would never subject myself to the pain of specialization. Currently, I am focused on studying data, people, and intelligence.</p>
        <p>When I am not building models or optimizing data pipelines, I am either working on personal research projects involving AI, neuroscience, and psychology OR reading a philosophy book. I must say, it has been a delightful journey - It keeps< boredom away.</p>
        <p>I also have two sacred rituals: 1. practicing piano, and 2. going on a daily get-as-much-sun-as-you-can forty minutes walk. 
        <p>I created this page to document my career journey.</p>

        <h2>Motto</h2>
        <blockquote>"To this day, I remain convinced of this basic philosophy: no matter what quandaries we face [...] there is an idea that can enable us to prevail. Furthermore, we can find that idea. And when we find it, we need to implement it. My life has been shaped by this imperative. The power of an idea - this is itself an idea." - Ray Kurzweil.</blockquote>

        i am chaimae, and these are some lines about big little life,<br> my dreams, frustrations, and battles, mostly against myself.

        <p>i was born in rabat, morocco,<br>
        i flew to canada back in 2017 for grad school (studying statistics)<br>
        it was a refreshing experience - i was working 60h+ per week and i have never felt more alive.

        0-5 yo: i can barely remember anything, but i have happy pictures, and remember looking at the sky, asking for the day to be over already (i was probably very bored), also i remember being sad over family members
