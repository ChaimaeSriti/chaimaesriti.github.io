        <h1>Hi, fellow human! ðŸ”†</h1>
        <p>I am ChaÃ¯mae ("shai-muh").</p>
        <p>I identify as a strong generalist and would never subject myself to the pain of specialization. Currently, I am focused on studying data, people, and intelligence.</p>
        <p>When I am not building models or optimizing data pipelines, I am either working on personal research projects involving AI, neuroscience, and psychology OR reading a philosophy book. I must say, it has been a delightful journey - It keeps boredom away.</p>
        <p>I also have two sacred rituals: 1. practicing piano, and 2. going on a daily get-as-much-sun-as-you-can forty minutes walk. Btw, I happily live in MontrÃ©al, Canada.</p>
        <p>I created this page to document this beautiful journey of mine, Life.</p>

        <h2>Motto</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "To this day, I remain convinced of this basic philosophy: no matter what quandaries we face [...] there is an idea that can enable us to prevail. Furthermore, we can find that idea. And when we find it, we need to implement it. My life has been shaped by this imperative. The power of an idea - this is itself an idea." - Ray Kurzweil.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am a perpetual student.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my MSc/PhD in Computer Science (concentration in AI) at McGill University with a primary focus on brain-inspired artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, and robotics.</p>
        <p>I studied Statistics at the University of Laval while pursuing a MSc; Thierry Duchesne and Louis-Paul Rivest were my advisors. My research was broadly focused on causal inference in observational studies.</p>

        <h2>Current Work</h2>
        <p>I am in the ideation phase of a MontrÃ©al-based AI Research Lab Project. Focus will be on improving machines' intelligence and building safe superintelligent agents leveraging the latest developments in AI and neuroscience. Btw, looking for Co-Founders (technical only!).</p>
        <p>I am a full-time Senior Data Scientist at an InsurTech company. My role involves optimizing pipelines and building large models to make data-versed pricing strategies.</p>

        <h2>Philointerest</h2>
        <p>Works of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Kierkegaard.</p>

        <h2>Question(s)</h2>
        <p>If all existing knowledge, ultimate strength capacity, supreme intelligence, and free will were to be embodied in a single machine, how would this machine reshape our world?</p>
