                revisiting ones values every now and then is important. - we are subject to change, and so our values. 
                life is simple, but we make it hard, the noise around us makes it hard. what others are doing, what you 
                think you should be doing right now instead of what are you doing. if you are doing. whether you will 
                succeed at leaving the legacy you think you're destined to. whether you're capable of achieving the things you think 
                you want to achieve.

                <br>
                <br>
                get inspired by kids, and animals. mainly cats. enjoy the act of being - think, but mostly, do, and mostly,
                do your best to be.

                    some jobs are different than others
                    <br> but one thing is common, the more authority you have in your work environment, the more meaningful your perception
                    of work will be. i realize recently how much this thing - but wait, is it authority, or ampleur. or both.
                    anyway, i was watching this journalist, succeeding, but it was mostly because of the ampleur, the lights, the impact (quite low since she was just sharing
                    news, publicly available to anyone online), leaving the core of her work to be all around her, her personality, her voice, her 'vibe'.
                    it was quite obvious, that such legacy is easier to establish than another. i miss the point, not sure anymore of what the first idea i wanted to convict was.
                    mostly about, being. about centering the work around self, around the most 'core' parts of our being, the geniune part. the one that doesn't require intelligence,
                    or 1000000 hours of work, the part that 'all other things being equal' stays the same. i think once one achieve to center their work around this piece,
                    start having a say, a vision, and ability to bring others on board, then they will have the possibility, to enjoy - to some degree - the nature of their work.
                    at a bigger scale.
                    i, on the other hand, certainly need this sort of feeling. i am thinking jobs like journalist, politician, monk.

                    *text to modify*
                    some people, like myself assumably [or like everyone, it is just that i am realizing it at a more core level],
                     need to have a significant level of authority in the 
                    environment where they exist to feel meaning 
                 and passion at work. we can argue that this level of authority is to be taken - for a reason - mainly work, i need to
                  feel the responsibility that i have a say, and whatever guidance 
                i am giving, is 
                <br>
                <br>
                i figured i am not againt using own's weak ego to achieve great things, ego can get you from 0 to starting.
                as soon as you are canalizing it right.

                lieu: Le petit Dep - 8:50 am, after waking up at 5, working a bit (not deep work) and watching ucusucu.

I am struggling with consistency. its a sunny day at montreal so i am very happy today. not sure where to start exactly.
I was enjoying the textbook very much but not anymore. I find myself wanting to get an offer asap.
which doesnt quite align with my goals. of learning and actually getting my brain to solve complex problems.
they opened a new coffee shop (starbucks)  in montreal, griffintown, where i live. I love it very much. coffee shops are my happy place. and this one will become my go-to soon. its very very nice.
anyway.
i am happy here. i just need a better time-space frame. and i need to get my focus to work.
and i need to prioritize right.
also i want to build a dating apps based on interests. somewhere i can drop: i am working at startbucks from 4 to 6 if anyone wants to join. :) and then get to know new people. those kind of phrases can happen once matched ofc. and for that you need a valid email, from a company or university.
also. i wanna have my own coffee shop in morocco. something similar to petit dep, or this starbucks.
somewhere people can be happy. and by themselves. this one will open from 6:30 to 10pm.
its right next to another restaurant called sue that I want to try.
its 2:28 now. I will start working on sql and take it from there.

<br>
<br>
tmw, i am planning to come here from 7 to 11:45 [study coding session], then head to reblunion [12-13], then eat @Le trou, then come back here around 2 or go to dep but ideally here.

good luck.

today i am lost, its 9:37 - took it slow this morning although i woke up at 6. 
there is a certain flow i am looking for - that i've lost, that i want to find again.
not sure why or what it is. but mostly, i want to find myself working for x hours without realizing time going.
reading books, isolating myself from the noise. continuously. doing math, coding, writing, reading, walking, playing piano.
eating and sleeping but only to be able to continue. until i reach the level of building something. that thing. the thing.
i want to feel the glory of persistency. i was reading [a slice of my mind] this morning and i felt jealous- jealous of that flow 
of work, of words, of vision. and one day - not far from today, i will get there. [i wrote hopefully and deleted it because it's such a desperate word.]   

<br>

it inspired me to start tracking days by hours. (ideally by minutes but it's not the most optimal way for focus).
<br>
currently entering blog post reading hour. [staring into the abyss as a core life skill].
here is a quote:
<br>
<br>
<i>Staring into the abyss means thinking reasonably about things that are uncomfortable to contemplate, like arguments against your religious beliefs, or in favor of breaking up with your partner. It’s common to procrastinate on thinking hard about these things because it might require you to acknowledge that you were very wrong about something in the past, and perhaps wasted a bunch of time based on that (e.g. dating the wrong person or praying to the wrong god). However, in most cases you have to either admit this eventually or, if you never admit it, lock yourself into a sub-optimal future life trajectory, so it’s best to be impatient and stare directly into the uncomfortable topic until you’ve figured out what to do.
    <br>
    <br>
This makes sense since both making effective life decisions and having novel insights require you to figure out non-obvious true things about the world, which are sometimes uncomfortable or scary, and therefore you’ll only figure them out if you’re good at staring into the abyss.
<br>
<br>
Another situation where people often procrastinate on staring into the abyss is when they take a job that turns out not to be very good. It’s common for people stay in these jobs for a surprisingly long time, even when the job market in their field is very hot and they could easily find a better position somewhere else.
<br>
<br>
Thinking about whether to leave your job is uncomfortable in a few different ways: it involves acknowledging that you made a poor decision in the past (taking your current job) that wasted a bunch of time; it involves signing up for a bunch more difficult, stressful work to interview at new jobs; and it saps your motivation to invest in getting better at your current job if you think it’s likely that you’ll leave soon. So it’s understandable that people procrastinate on staring into that abyss. But that procrastination leads to a lot of avoidable suffering.

<br>
<br>
I got lucky to work closely with Drew, but I expect it’s possible to seek out people who are great at this. You could evaluate this while reverse-interviewing your future manager and peers: “tell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision. How did you realize it you needed to do that?” And look for evidence that they acted quickly and didn’t dither or procrastinate. If you’re looking at early-stage startups, consider making this one of the top things you look for, since it’s so important to the eventual outcome. (This suggestion is speculative; I haven’t tried it.)
<br>
<br>

Staring into the abyss about your job is difficult in part because it’s easier to do good work if you’re committed to your job for a long time. The same principle applies even more to romantic relationships: past some threshold of compatibility, much of your relationship’s value comes precisely from the fact that the two of you expect to being together for a long time, and can make correspondingly long-term investments in making your relationship awesome.
This suggests that a critical part of being effective at staring into the abyss is timing. If you do it too little, you’ll end up taking too long to make important life improvements; but if you do it too often, you might end up not investing enough in being great at your current job or relationship because you’re too focused on the prospect of next one.

My hope with this essay is to convince you to stare into the abyss a bit more. To help with that, I’ll close with some uncomfortable but hopefully productive questions:

<li>If you had to leave your job today, what would you do instead?</li>
<li>What’s the best argument in favor of doing that right now?</li>
<li>If you have a partner, what’s the best argument in favor of breaking up with them?</li>
<li>Are there ways you behave that you wish you didn’t? What unacknowledged desires could be driving those?</li>
<li>What have you said “yes” to that you wouldn’t say “hell yes” to? (prompted by Alex Watt)</li>
<li>Is there something you “should” do that you’re not currently doing? Why? (prompted by Silas Strawn)</li>
<li>What bad things are you afraid of happening? Imagine in detail what it would be like if they happened. (prompted by Kamilé Lukosiute)</li>
<li>What do you need that you’re not currently getting? (—David MacIver)</li>
<li>What are you avoiding because it conflicts with some part of your identity / self-image? (—Nicholas Schiefer; more at link)</li>
<li>“What is the biggest thing in your life that you just kinda casually fell into and would you have made a conscious decision to do it if you’d known in advance everything you know now?” (—@GeniesLoki; hundreds more at link)</li>
