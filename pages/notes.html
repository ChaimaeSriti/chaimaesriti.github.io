                revisiting ones values every now and then is important. - we are subject to change, and so our values. 
                life is simple, but we make it hard, the noise around us makes it hard. what others are doing, what you 
                think you should be doing right now instead of what are you doing. if you are doing. whether you will 
                succeed at leaving the legacy you think you're destined to. whether you're capable of achieving the things you think 
                you want to achieve.

                <br>
                <br>
                get inspired by kids, and animals. mainly cats. enjoy the act of being - think, but mostly, do, and mostly,
                do your best to be.

                    some jobs are different than others
                    <br> but one thing is common, the more authority you have in your work environment, the more meaningful your perception
                    of work will be. i realize recently how much this thing - but wait, is it authority, or ampleur. or both.
                    anyway, i was watching this journalist, succeeding, but it was mostly because of the ampleur, the lights, the impact (quite low since she was just sharing
                    news, publicly available to anyone online), leaving the core of her work to be all around her, her personality, her voice, her 'vibe'.
                    it was quite obvious, that such legacy is easier to establish than another. i miss the point, not sure anymore of what the first idea i wanted to convict was.
                    mostly about, being. about centering the work around self, around the most 'core' parts of our being, the geniune part. the one that doesn't require intelligence,
                    or 1000000 hours of work, the part that 'all other things being equal' stays the same. i think once one achieve to center their work around this piece,
                    start having a say, a vision, and ability to bring others on board, then they will have the possibility, to enjoy - to some degree - the nature of their work.
                    at a bigger scale.
                    i, on the other hand, certainly need this sort of feeling. i am thinking jobs like journalist, politician, monk.

                    *text to modify*
                    some people, like myself assumably [or like everyone, it is just that i am realizing it at a more core level],
                     need to have a significant level of authority in the 
                    environment where they exist to feel meaning 
                 and passion at work. we can argue that this level of authority is to be taken - for a reason - mainly work, i need to
                  feel the responsibility that i have a say, and whatever guidance 
                i am giving, is 
                <br>
                <br>
                i figured i am not againt using own's weak ego to achieve great things, ego can get you from 0 to starting.
                as soon as you are canalizing it right.

I am struggling with consistency. its a sunny day at montreal so i am very happy today. not sure where to start exactly.
I was enjoying the textbook very much but not anymore. I find myself wanting to get an offer asap.
which doesnt quite align with my goals. of learning and actually getting my brain to solve complex problems.
they opened a new coffee shop (starbucks)  in montreal, griffintown, where i live. I love it very much. coffee shops are my happy place. and this one will become my go-to soon. its very very nice.
anyway.
i am happy here. i just need a better time-space frame. and i need to get my focus to work.
and i need to prioritize right.
also i want to build a dating apps based on interests. somewhere i can drop: i am working at startbucks from 4 to 6 if anyone wants to join. :) and then get to know new people. those kind of phrases can happen once matched ofc. and for that you need a valid email, from a company or university.
also. i wanna have my own coffee shop in morocco. something similar to petit dep, or this starbucks.
somewhere people can be happy. and by themselves. this one will open from 6:30 to 10pm.
its right next to another restaurant called sue that I want to try.
its 2:28 now. I will start working on sql and take it from there.

<br>
<br>
tmw, i am planning to come here from 7 to 11:45 [study coding session], then head to reblunion [12-13], then eat @Le trou, then come back here around 2 or go to dep but ideally here.

good luck.
